# Midterm Exam

## Question 1

10 / 15 pts

Describe the main difference between Product-based software management and Project-based software management.

> Product based software engineering is a process where the programmers compose all three points of the triangle: They are the 'customer' for the work, they set the requirements for the work, and then perform the work. Being the customer here means that they must identify the opportunity, and design the product too. In this way, you may think of product-based software management as a 'start-up' model. 

> This 'start-up' model is contrasted with the project-based model, which represents a more typical workplace: A customer, typically a boss or manager, gives direction, then they and the performers agree on requirements, then the performers complete the task. 

> These differ in that one of them is performed by only the engineers themselves (product-based), while project based is guided by a manager or customer, who needs something done.

### Feedback

> The statement “A customer, typically a boss or manager” is misleading. Typically, a customer is an external client, while a manager is a person who manages the team of developers and, usually, negotiates with the customer. Also, product-based engineering can be guided by a manager too.
 
## Question 2

12 / 15 pts

Describe and illustrate the phases of the project planning process.

> Depending on project style and completion method, one can experience many different project planning phases. Generally, though, these consist of:

> Establishing requirements (if not already laid out in SOW) - for example, a company contracted to make cheerios video game might have among their requirements that they should brand the game with the cheerios logo throughout, and relate it to the cereal as much as possible. 

> The manager must break down the project into tasks. Each of these tasks should be neither too large nor too small for a person to complete. In the cheerios example, each level's graphic design might be a separate task, the programming of any actions might be a task, the music might be one, and so on.

> The manager creates a cohesive group (one with personality types that complement each other, rather than are similar). For example, no two people with self-oriented type will be the only people on the team, there needs to be balance.

> The Manager will then assign tasks to each team member, and schedule these so that each team member is not working on more than 1 task at a time (ideally).

### Feedback

> Missing names and definitions of three phases: Proposal, Startup, and Development Phase. The development phase is not mentioned in the response.
 
## Question 3

15 / 15 pts

How should a software product vision be defined according to Moore's vision template?

> FOR <target market description> WHO <description of needs of target market>, <product> IS A <category of product> THAT <explain benefits / goals / features> UNLIKE <competition> OUR PRODUCT <differentiation from competition>

## Question 4

15 / 15 pts

Explain the pros and cons of the software plan-driven development approach.

> Cons: Plan driven software engineering is not great, as it is antiquated (it is the 'standard', or Old School method). It's most important con is that it requires critical descisions to be made early, maybe even when there is less information about how project execution will/is going. These decisions are hard to change too, as this model is pretty strict about keeping to plan, and not altering it throughout. Therefore, decisions have to be made early and this does not create much flexibility. A secondary con is that this method feels much less personal, more cold, to employees working it: it feels set in stone, and the performers cannot perform faster or slower than planned.

> Pros: These cons are also pros, depending on the situation. In a large company, it is easy to see how a plan-based approach could be great, where thousands of projects are running, and cannot be accounted for at the same time, so they must stick to plans made ahead of time. There is another pro to plan-based SE, though, which is that issues can be considered thoroughly. As compared to agile, plan-based lays out the issues upfront and contemplates them, possibly for quite a long while, to ensure that the plan is robust and functional. In agile, sometimes, these issues might not get this kind of attention.

## Question 5

15 / 15 pts

Briefly describe the two types of estimation techniques discussed during the course: Experience-based techniques and algorithmic cost modeling.

> Experience-based estimation is very traditional: it is, as one would expect, someone using their past knowledge of performance to gauge future performance. This comes in very handy the more projects the manager making this estimation has seen: with each project, they become more proficient and accurate in gauging the time and effort needed to complete a project. Here, a manager will sit down, and estimate the time to complete each task in the list, and then sum those times to create the time it will take to complete the project (or LOCs, or FP or whatever they are interested in estimating).

> Function-based or Algorithmic modeling is where one uses an algorithm that factors in, among other things, the past performance of the company and the level of novelty of this product, to estimate the time to completion it will take. This is especially useful when a new manager is attempting to estimate a project in a company they are not familiar with: they do not have the expertise and experience to estimate using Experience-based estimation, so they rely on this algorithm to get an estimation.
 
## Question 6

15 / 15 pts

What factors should be considered when deciding on a price for software?

> Many important factors play in to how you should price the software. These can include:

> The Contract, and its terms: If you can create a longer term contract, you might offer the software for less as you will be assured continual revenue.

> Cost Estimate Uncertainty: depending on how sure you are of your cost estimate for the software, you might consider pricing it higher to account for any issues in the cost estimate you made.

> Financial Health: If your company is doing great, and you can afford to wait for someone who will pay a high rate, do so. Otherwise, you should price (lower) to sell, so that you can get returns right away.

> Market Opportunity: depending on the level of opportunity in the space you are entering with your product, you might price it higher (novel product) or lower (price to win against busy space)

> Requirements Volatility: if the requirements are subject to change, and what extent they are subject to change, might impact how much you offer the product for. For example, if you think you can reduce the requirements later, you might price low, to undercut the competition while still winning, and being able to make profit.
 
## Question 7

15 / 15 pts

What are the most important differences between agile planning and plan-based development?

> The very most important difference between Agile and Plan-Based is the timeline for planning and execution. While Agile reevaluates the execution, requirements, schedule and task assignment on an ongoing basis, the plan-based method is fixed at the start of the program, and that plan is set in stone before execution begins. Further differences include that Agile uses releases or iterations rather than plan-based that (at most) uses task completion, and likely just uses final product. Further, Agile considers new methods of meeting requirements such as user stories, where plan-based is typically more fixed on the requirements. Also, plan based's plan is developed statically at the start of the project, while Agile's plan is iteratively developed, adapted, refined and perfected throughout the project. Agile can account for and work around big events in the project, such as absences, while Project-based cannot exactly account for those, and would have to have a large built-in overhead to have headroom for that kind of event. 

> All in all, you may consider Agile to be like a river, it adapts its course to get to the goal as it gets there, whereas the Plan-Based is like a canal: there are plans for the canal that say where it will go and how it will do that, and there is no way that canal can deviate.
